Any individual found to be tampering with the entry process or  Contest in any way, or to be acting in violation of these Official Rules or in an unsportsmanlike or disruptive manner, will be subject to disqualification at the Sponsor’s sole discretion. Any attempt by any person to circumvent the requirements or the operation of the Contest may constitute a violation of criminal and civil law, and, the Sponsor reserves the right to seek damages to the fullest extent permitted by law from any such person. No provision is waived due to the Sponsor’s failure to enforce any term of these Official Rules.
